# Looker Studio

Creating Dashboards with Google Looker Studio

This project was developed using the architecture provided by Google Cloud Platform:

- A virtual machine was used to interact with BigQuery, Cloud SQL, and Google Storage using R
- BigQuery was used to store and manipulate the Cookie Level Data
- Cloud Storage was used to store the files that we worked with
- Cloud SQL was used to upload the tables from the files
- Google Looker Studio was used to bring all of the elements together in one place and create the dashboards
